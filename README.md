🧠 JavaScript Problem Solving Practice

This repository contains my JavaScript problem-solving exercises — starting from beginner and moving towards intermediate and advanced levels.
I’m using this repo to practice, improve, and track my progress as I continue learning and exploring new JavaScript logic challenges.

📚 Topics Covered So Far
🟢 Beginner Level

Basics: Variables, Data Types, Operators

Conditional Statements (if, else, switch)

Loops (for, while, do-while)

Functions (normal & arrow functions)

Arrays and Strings (basic operations)

Problems practiced:

Reverse a string

Count vowels

Find factorial

Check palindrome

Check even and odd numbers

Find largest number in an array

Check if number is prime

🟡 Intermediate Level

Array methods: map, filter, reduce, forEach

Nested loops and logic-based problems

Recursion

Number & string manipulation

Problems practiced:

Remove duplicates from array

Find missing number in sequence

Find intersection of arrays

Flatten nested arrays

Move all zeros to end

Find first non-repeating character

Optimized prime number check using Math.sqrt()

Factorial with BigInt support


🎯 Purpose

This is a personal practice repository to strengthen my understanding of:

Core JavaScript concepts

Logical problem-solving

Interview-style coding challenges

I’ll keep adding new problems as I practice more advanced questions (like recursion, sorting, searching, and algorithms).

🪄 Future Practice Goals

Advanced array & string algorithms

Searching and sorting techniques

Pattern problems

Recursion challenges

Data structure basics (stack, queue, etc.)
